So, the idea is to generate chill graphics as in a visualizer for music that
generates glitchy patterns and geometric shapes with varying rythms and some
slight offset, in a lo-fi or vaporwave style.

It's my first toying with graphics programming so it's really crap for the
moment but I hope it will get to something cool somewhere soon.
